        <p>
          I like making things that are accessible online. When my brother gave
          me a MacBook Air in 2016, I became interested in iOS development and
          began creating little applications for amusement.

          Today, having started my career with a small startup, a rapid-growth
          business, and a large corporation has been a privilege. Building
          inclusive, accessible products and digital experiences for Majid Al
          Futtaim is my main emphasis right now.
